# Pillar: Growth

## Scope
The growth scope will focus on securing initial adoption by proving value and building trust through a robust human-in-the-loop model, enabling incremental autonomy for individual developers and small teams. Subsequent growth will involve expanding integrations and customization options to serve diverse enterprise environments and scale across Google's broader ecosystem, continually enhancing the AI's capabilities for more complex engineering tasks.

## Dependencies
- Dependencies on other pillars
- External dependencies

## Key Metrics
- **Monthly Active Engineers (MAE):** The number of unique software engineers interacting with or leveraging the autonomous agent within a given month.
- **Projects Under Autonomous Management:** The total count of active software projects or repositories where the autonomous engineer is actively integrated and performing tasks.
- **AI-Authored Code Contribution Rate:** The percentage of successfully merged code (e.g., lines of code, pull requests) that were primarily generated or completed by the autonomous engineer.
- **Successful Autonomous Task Completion Rate:** The ratio of autonomously executed tasks (e.g., bug fixes, feature implementations, test generations) that meet defined acceptance criteria without human intervention, relative to total assigned autonomous tasks.

## Initiatives
1.  INIT_PHASED_ADOPTION: Implement a multi-stage adoption model starting with advanced AI assistance (co-pilot mode for specific tasks) and gradually increasing autonomy as users gain trust and observe demonstrated value, targeting specific, high-ROI use cases first (e.g., boilerplate code, test generation, simple bug fixes).
2.  INIT_GCP_ECOSYSTEM_LEVERAGE: Deeply integrate with and optimize for the Google Cloud Platform and Gemini ecosystem, showcasing unparalleled performance and efficiency benefits of Gemini 3 Flash for existing Google Cloud users, fostering rapid adoption within this receptive segment.
3.  INIT_COMMUNITY_DRIVEN_TRUST: Foster a strong developer community around explainability, customizability, and human-in-the-loop controls, providing clear audit trails and feedback mechanisms to build trust and empower engineers rather than displace them.
4.  INIT_NICHE_SOLUTION_EXPANSION: Identify and aggressively pursue initial niche problem areas within software engineering where autonomous AI can provide disproportionate value (e.g., specific language migrations, compliance-driven code generation, automated refactoring), then systematically expand capabilities based on proven success and user demand.
