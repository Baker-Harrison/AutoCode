# Vision

## Mission
Enable "Autonomous software engineer" implies the AI can perform the vast majority, if not all, tasks typically handled by a human software engineer without direct human intervention. to a fully automated, end-to-end ai system designed to independently handle the entire software development lifecycle – from conceptualization and design to coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance – leveraging an extremely fast and efficient 'gemini 3 flash' ai model to accelerate every stage..

## Principles
1. **User-Centric:** Every decision starts with user needs
2. **Simplicity First:** Default to simple over feature-rich
3. **Privacy by Design:** Minimize data collection
4. **Iterate Fast:** Ship often, learn quickly

## North Star Metric
Our North Star is to dramatically accelerate software innovation and delivery by providing an autonomous, high-quality, and cost-efficient AI software engineering agent. This will enable developers and organizations to build, evolve, and maintain production-grade software with unprecedented speed and reliability.

## 3-Year Narrative
- **Year 1:** Launch MVP, establish product-market fit
- **Year 2:** Expand platforms, grow user base 10x
- **Year 3:** Become category leader, explore monetization
